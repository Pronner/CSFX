# ðŸŽ¨ CSFX (The .NET CSS Designing Library)
CSFX is a .NET Library created to serve interface designing on Forms using CSS.

You'll be able to create compex, basic, and intuitive designs for your .NET Application using CSS. However, there are a few custom properties that allow you to change some parts of the form, and the form functionality.

- **Custom Properties:**
```
csfx-form-text,
csfx-doublebuffered,
csfx-form-controls,
csfx-form-showicon,
csfx-form-alwaysontop,
csfx-form-showintaskbar,
csfx-form-borderstyle,
dynamictransparency,
position-x,
position-y,
background-image-layout,
text,
shadow,
border-size,
size (effects both height and width)
```
